# xmos-startkit-examples

Example code created while exploring development using the XMOS StartKIT
development board.

## Getting Started

Download and install xTIMEcomposer from https://www.xmos.com/support/tools.

Setup your environment to run the command line tools. To do this, source the
`SenEnv.sh` script that is packaged with xTIMEcomposer, updating the path and
version to match your installation.

```sh
source /Applications/XMOS_xTIMEcomposer_Community_14.0.2/SetEnv.sh
```

You should now be able to run the command line tools packaged with xTIMEcomposer
in the current shell.
